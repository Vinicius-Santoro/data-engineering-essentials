## **Objective**

Hello, nice to meet you, I'm Vinicius!

Until the end of 2024, I worked in a business squad, focused on data analysis.  However, I discovered my interest in combining software engineering with data and I am starting my career as a data engineer!

**The purpose of this site is to document my learning process to become a data engineer.**

According to [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/training/career-paths/data-engineer), a data engineer integrates, transforms, and consolidates data from multiple structured and unstructured data systems into structures suitable for creating analytics solutions.

To achieve this goal, I am structuring my studies based on the following fundamental pillars:

- Cloud AWS.
- Big Data.
- Database.
- Schedule.
- Devops.
- Data architectures.
